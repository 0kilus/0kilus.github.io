The Stoic

### [](#Marcus_Aurelius)[Marcus Aurelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius)

Everything is banal in experience, fleeting in duration, sordid in content; in all respects the same today as generations now dead and buried have found it to be.  
  
How good it is, when you have roast meat or such like foods before you, to impress on your mind that this is the dead body of a fish, this the dead body of a bird or pig.  

A Man's life is dyed the color of his imagination.  

We ought to do good to others as simply as a horse runs, or a bee makes honey, or a vine bears grapes season after season without thinking of the grapes it has borne.  



### [](#Epictetus)[Epictetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus)  

Do not get too attached to life. For it is like a sailor's leave on the shore and at any time, the captain may sound the horn, calling you back to eternal darkness.  

If you wish to be good, first believe that you are bad.
